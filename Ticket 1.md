# Ticket MIDP-307

The reporting team needs to find loyal customers to give them some loot. They requested a one time adhoc ask to get the following people using the data up to the 15th of October:

> **Do not include** the data inside ./data_for_ticket_2/ for this ticket.

1. The top 10 people who purchased the largest number of products
2. The top 10 people who purchased the largest number of products while being an active member

## Acceptance Criteria

Run the two queries, and create two `.csv` files. Include the customers' names, emails and quantity of items purchased (in total when active and inactive member), and save them with the name `sales_report.csv` and
`sales_report_active_member.csv` respectively.
